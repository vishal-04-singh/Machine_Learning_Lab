# Machine Learning Lab

This repository contains resources and code for experiments and exercises in machine learning using Python.

## Contents

- `Linear.py`: Python script performing linear regression or related linear machine learning experiments.
- `Dataset.csv`: Dataset used in the experiments, likely containing features and labels for regression or classification tasks.
- `Figure_1.png`: Visualization or plot generated from the experiments, such as regression results or data exploration.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vishal-04-singh/Machine_Learning_Lab.git
   cd Machine_Learning_Lab
   ```

2. **Requirements**
   - Python 3.x
   - Required Python libraries (install using pip if needed, e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`)

3. **Running the Experiment**
   - Run the main script:
     ```sh
     python Linear.py
     ```
   - Check `Figure_1.png` for output visualization.

## Description

This project is intended as a practical lab for exploring and implementing basic machine learning concepts, particularly linear regression. The code demonstrates:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Applying linear regression to the dataset
- Visualizing the results
